# Credit Card Spend Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview
This project uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalous credit card transactions. The goal is to identify suspicious transactions that may indicate fraud.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Algorithm Used
Isolation Forest

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- Visualization of anomalous transactions
- Result analysis

## Results
The model successfully identified anomalous transactions based on unusual patterns in the dataset.

## Visualizations

### Anomaly Detection Scatter Plot
This visualization shows detected anomalous transactions highlighted separately from normal transactions.
